- armv8 cores are a 86 bit architecture and use 64 bit registers
- the NEON unit uses 128 bit registers for simd processing

- the NEON register file is a collection of registers which can be accessed as 8-bit, 16, 32, 64, 128 bit registers

- the neon registers contain vectors of elements of the same data type.
  - the same element position in the input and output registers are
    referred to as a lane

- usually each neon instruction resuts in n operations occuring in parallel
  where n is the number of lanes that the input vectors are divided into

- each operation is contained within the lane. There cannot be a carry
  or overflow from one lane to another

- the number of lanes in a neon vector depends on the size of the vector
  and thed at
