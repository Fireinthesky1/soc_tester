ARM64=armv8-A

- an access is aligned if the address is a multiple of the element size
- for LDR and STR instructions, the element size is the size of the access.
- when an address is not a mutliple of the element size, the access is unaligned,
- unaligned accesses are allowed to addresses marked as normal, but not to Device regions.
- an unaligned access toa  Device region will trigger an exception (alignment fault)

- Armv8-A instruction fetches are always treated as little endian.

- for data accesses is it implementation defined whether both little endian and big endian are supported and if only one is supported is it implementation defined which one is supported
